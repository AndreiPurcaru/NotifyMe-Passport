# NotifyMe - Passport

This small application was built using [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/). Its purpose is to
hook into the API provided by the Romanian [DGP](https://epasapoarte.ro/) and send timed notifications letting people know of available
timeslots between specified dates.
